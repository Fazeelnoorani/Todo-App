A simple web-based To-Do List application that allows users to add, mark, and delete tasks. The application also saves tasks in local storage to persist data across sessions.

Features:

Add tasks to the list.
Mark tasks as completed.
Remove tasks from the list.
Save tasks automatically using local storage.

Technologies Used:

1.HTML
2.CSS
3.JavaScript (Vanilla JS)

Installation & Usage:

Clone the repository or download the source code.

Ensure the project folder contains the following structure:

/project-folder
├── index.html
├── /assets
    ├── /css
        ├── style.css
    ├── /js
        ├── index.js
    ├── /images
        ├── icon.png

Open index.html in a web browser.

How It Works:

Type a task into the input field and click the Add button.

Click on a task to mark it as completed.

Click the × button next to a task to remove it.

The tasks are automatically saved in local storage and retrieved upon reloading the page.

Local Storage Functionality:

The application uses the browser's localStorage to save tasks so that they remain available even after closing the browser.
